# Development Plan: Relationshipsmanager Platform

**Project Goal:** To create a cross-platform (Web, Android, iOS) "Relationshipsmanager" application for managing contacts, interactions, and reminders.

**Core Technologies:**
* **Frontend (Web & Mobile UI):** Vite, React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS
* **Mobile Wrapper:** Capacitor (recommended for code reuse)
* **Backend API:** (Assumed to be developed separately - e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, etc. with a RESTful or GraphQL API)
* **Database:** (To be chosen - e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

        * Storing core contact info: Name, Email, Phone, DOB, Notes.
        * "Your own entry about contact" vs "Contact's own entry" distinction.
        * Basic "Last contact" and "Next contact" date tracking.
        * Visual status indicators (Red/Yellow/Green) based on contact dates.
        * Basic Notes per contact.

2.  **UI/UX Design & Component Library Setup:**
    * Create detailed wireframes and mockups for all MVP screens (web-first, responsive).
    * Leverage `shadcn-ui` components for rapid UI development.
    * Define a consistent design language using Tailwind CSS.

    * Develop React components for:
        * Contact List View (with sorting/filtering stubs).
        * Contact Detail View.
        * Contact Creation/Edit Forms (using `shadcn-ui` form components).
    * Integrate with mock contact API endpoints.

**Deliverables:**
* Documented MVP feature list and user stories.

* **Documentation:**
    * **Code Documentation:** Comments, READMEs.
    * **API Documentation:** (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).
    * **User Documentation/Help Guides.**
* **Version Control (Git):** Consistent use of branching strategies (e.g., Gitflow), pull requests, and code reviews.
* **Project Management:** Agile methodologies (Scrum or Kanban) with regular sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. Tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana.
* **Communication:** Clear and consistent communication within the development team and with stakeholders.
