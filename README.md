# Relationshipsmanager

A tool to stay in touch with people and build remarkable relationships. 

Relationshipsmanager is a software for web, your computer (later) and telephones (apps). 

It connects social media and e-mail accounts and reminds you when you have to contact your contacts.

It also colours your contact entries in defined (by you) an urgency colors e.g. green (you are ok in terms of contacting this person), yellow (soon you will need to contact the person), orange (you need to contact the person), red (the contacting of the person is overdue). 

It's simply your new and a much better contact tool.
