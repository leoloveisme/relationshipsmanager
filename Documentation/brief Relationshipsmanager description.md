Relationshipsmanager is the tool to stay in touch with people and build remarkable relationships.

Think extended contact app like e.g. Fossify Contacts with additional functionality

Relationshipsmanager is software for:

mobile devices (apps)
web (app) 
and
your computer (later)

It colours your contact entries in defined (by users) urgency colors e.g. green (you are ok in terms of contacting this person), yellow (soon you will need to contact the person), orange (you need to contact the person), red (the contacting of the person is overdue).

User can define him- / herself how many days will constitute how many days will define the colors

e.g. 

entry (each entry has independent settings)

Mother 

green < 7 days
yellow < 14 days
orange < 21 days
red > 30 days

Nephew

green < 14 days
yellow < 30 days
orange < 45 days
red > 60 days

etc

groups:

e.g.

Favorites
Friends
Close friends
Family
Relatives
etc

Users can CRUD 

- entries (add new ones, delete existing ones, modify, etc)
- groups (add new groups, modify existing ones, rename, delete - danger zone)

Deleting group doesn't delete the entries in the app (and in the database)

Each group and each contact entry (even within a group) can have independent settings

Contact entry can be part of various groups

Relationshipsmanager can connect social media and e-mail accounts if user decides to do so and reminds him / her when (s)he have to contact his / her contacts.

Reminders

Scenario:

User has contacted his / her mother by telephone or was contacted by his / her mother by telephone  - the day count is resetted. 

User can also manually reset the day count in the entry at any time

****

The software can work both online and offline with automatic synchonisation with relationshipsmanager database and / or cloud storage - database in the form of files - extended contact detail files with **history** of contacts, etc if user decides so / when user activates sync (sync can also be deactivated - checkbox)

Relationshipsmanager is simply the new and a much better relationships managing tool.

More features and functionality is yet to come.
